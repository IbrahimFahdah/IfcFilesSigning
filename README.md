# IfcFilesSigning

This repository is a proof of concept for digitally signing IFC files.

Digital signatures play a crucial role in authenticating documents and ensuring data integrity in the digital age. In BIM-based projects, stakeholders frequently exchange various document formats throughout the project lifecycle. While many of these formats can already be digitally signed, the process for IFC files, when it becomes necessary, is not discussed. Adding a digital signature to an IFC file is a straightforward process: a unique cryptographic signature is generated, securely binding the signer's identity to the IFC file.
